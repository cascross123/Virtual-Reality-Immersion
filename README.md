# Virtual-Reality-Immersion
This code forms the basis of my Third year Dissertation investigating user immersion in virtual reality experiences. 
The Project sets out to achieve the aim of increasing the users immersion by accurately tracking the users feet in the virtual reality world. 

This will allow the player to walk around an experience, and the end goal is to be able to kick a football, and interact with buildings in the world. 

Any questions about this project should be directed to 12454187@students.lincoln.ac.uk
